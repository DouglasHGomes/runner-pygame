# Runner

This is a simple game created using Pygame.

The motivation behind this project was to learn the fundamentals of game programming while also gaining proficiency in Python.

The entire project was developed following the tutorial provided by Clear Code on YouTube. You can find the link below. While the core game remains the same, I have made certain alterations that I found useful or attempted to implement a different structure that I considered more relevant.
